Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? why do
you need to do it?

can use in the future to commit changes.

and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

and the repository, if we want i file to be tracked we need to
add it to the staging area. otherwise it wont be trakced.

commit per logical change?
A: by commiting sparate files that each has a logical change.

Q4: What are some situations when branches would be helpful
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A: when adding new experimental feature, or when trying to change
some old stuff and see what happenes. Branches would help by
organizing changes with separate comits.
