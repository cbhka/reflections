Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? why do
you need to do it?
A: a file called .git will be added to the directory, that
contains metadata about the repository. 
I need to to it, so git creates a new repository that i 
can use in the future to commit changes.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: the staging area is a conncetion between the working directory
and the repository, if we want i file to be tracked we need to
add it to the staging area. otherwise it wont be trakced.
