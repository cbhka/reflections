Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?
A: mostly when working with a team, and maybe when
creating an open source projec.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
A:You might be experimenting a new feature in you local
repository, and Don't want to pull the new changes in
the remote repo.

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones,
and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forking is the act of copying another repo from someone
else in the hope of doing pull request of the changes later.
clone is the act of creating a entair sparate copy of
a repository, and not worrying about changing the cloned 
repo.
branched work on commits not on repositories, and are
used to create sparate time line of changes on a commit.
